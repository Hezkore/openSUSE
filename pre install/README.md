## Initial Install

I've switched over to install openSUSE via the Agama installer directly for now.

Download: https://agama-project.github.io/download

To prepare the USB stick, I use:

* Windows: [Rufus](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus)
* Linux: [SUSE ImageWriter](https://github.com/openSUSE/imagewriter)
	- <small>Part of every openSUSE distro package manager: `sudo zypper install imagewriter`</small>
* Linux Alt: [Impression](https://flathub.org/apps/io.gitlab.adhami3310.Impression)
	- <small>Impression is part of most distros package manager: `sudo zypper install impression`</small>
	- <small>Also available as Flatpak</small>

In the installer, I pick Tumbleweed, even though Slowroll is available now.

XFCE is the choice of desktop environment.

I disable every YaST tool and package.\
And I make sure to enable the non-free repo as well.
