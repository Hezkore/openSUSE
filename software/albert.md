# Albert

[Albert](https://albertlauncher.github.io/) lets us start things super quickly.\
You press Ctrl + Space and then type anything, like an app, a website, a shortcut to a website, a command or math or anything else.

Super easy to install via `opi`:
```bash
sudo opi -n albert && (albert &> /dev/null &)
```

Albert should now be in the system tray.\
Press Ctrl + Space to open Albert, then type `albert` to open settings and enable all the plugins you need.

I always enable at least:
* Applications
* Calculator
* URL Handler
* Web search
- <small>I enable some extra search engines like GitHub, and also change the "short" for some</small>
