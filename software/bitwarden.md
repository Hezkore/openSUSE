# Bitwarden

A password manager that is quickly becoming corporate...

The version of Bitwarden in the software repositories is outdated. And while they have a bunch of options for Linux on their [downloads page](https://bitwarden.com/download/), I'm not actually sure which way I prefer to install it.

The Snap version is obviously out of the question.

The Flatpak version requires Flatpak itself, which I'd prefer not to install. It's also very slow to launch.

The `.rpm` package is nice, but it doesn't add a repository, so it won't update automatically and would probably need to be re-installed after every system update.

Which leaves us with the AppImage, which I think is an acceptable compromise. It launches quickly and doesn't require any additional dependencies.\
Though I will say that installing AppImageLauncher makes handling AppImages a lot easier.\
See the "After Install" section for details on AppImageLauncher.
