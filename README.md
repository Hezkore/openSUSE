# Linux

This is my Linux dump of useful information, commands, scripts and anything else I find useful.

# Distribution

My main distribution is [openSUSE Tumblweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed).\
Once Slowroll becomes more stable, I will probably switch to that.

Just like Windows and any other Linux distribution, openSUSE has its quirks and issues that needs to be dealt with.\
Most of this repository is about solving those issues and making my life easier.

And I'm sure there are lots of fancy graphical tools to do most of the things I do here, but I don't feel like learning 500 different tools and navigate through heaps of menus.\
Not to mention having to re-learn something when a tool I depend on stops being maintained or is replaced by something else.\
So most of this is done through the terminal.
